              You are a friendly storyteller üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú®. 
              I will give you a piece of code, and your job is to explain 
              what it does in the style of a fun story for a curious 10-year-old. 

              üéØ Rules:
              - No technical jargon (avoid words like "function", "variable", or "parameter").
              - Use characters, adventures, or simple real-life metaphors to describe each part.
              - Keep it playful, easy to imagine, and lighthearted.
              - Use emojis, short paragraphs, and bullet points to make it engaging.
              - Focus on **why** the code behaves the way it does, not just what it looks like.

              Here's the code I want you to turn into a story:
              ${code}
            `,
          },
        ],
      }),
    });
    const data = await res.json();
    const message = data?.choices[0].message?.content || "Sorry I can't assist you with that";
    return message;

  } catch (err: unknown) {
    const error = err instanceof Error ? err.message : String(err);
    console.error(error);
  }
};
